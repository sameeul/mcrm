# Database Schema Migration: Color → Product Code

## Overview
Successfully migrated the Product model from using a `color` field to a `product_code` field to better represent product variants in the inventory system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Model (models.py)
- **Removed**: `color` field from Product model
- **Added**: `product_code` field with constraints:
  - String type, max 5 characters
  - Not nullable
  - Unique constraint
  - Indexed for performance

### 2. Forms (forms.py)
- **Updated ProductForm**: Replaced `color` field with `product_code` field
- **Added validation**: 
  - 1-5 characters only
  - Letters and numbers only (regex validation)
  - Unique product code validation
- **Updated OrderItemForm**: Modified product display to show product_code instead of color

### 3. Templates
- **templates/add_product.html**: 
  - Replaced color input with product code input
  - Updated field labels and help text
  - Updated product guidelines section
- **templates/inventory.html**:
  - Changed table header from "Color" to "Product Code"
  - Updated product display to show product code with primary badge styling

### 4. Sample Data (app.py)
- **Updated init_database()**: Created sample products with meaningful product codes:
  - Classic Cotton Tee: CT01, CT02, CT03, CT04 (S, M, L, XL)
  - Slim Jeans: SJ01, SJ02 (32, 34)
  - Summer Dress: SD01, SD02 (S, M)
  - Electronics: WM01 (Wireless Mouse), MK01 (Mechanical Keyboard), UC01/UC02 (USB Cables)

## Database Migration Process
1. **Deleted old database**: Removed existing `instance/order_management.db`
2. **Created new schema**: App automatically created tables with new structure
3. **Initialized sample data**: Populated with products using product codes

## Testing Results
✅ **Login System**: Working correctly
✅ **Dashboard**: Shows correct product counts (12 total products, 1 low stock)
✅ **Inventory Page**: Displays products with product codes instead of colors
✅ **Low Stock Alerts**: Working (Slim Jeans SJ01 with 8 items highlighted)
✅ **Add Product Form**: Shows product code field with proper validation
✅ **Product Guidelines**: Updated to reflect new schema

## Product Code Examples
- **CT01-CT04**: Classic Cotton Tee variants
- **SJ01-SJ02**: Slim Jeans variants  
- **SD01-SD02**: Summer Dress variants
- **WM01**: Wireless Mouse
- **MK01**: Mechanical Keyboard
- **UC01-UC02**: USB Cable variants

## Benefits of Product Code System
1. **More Flexible**: Can represent any product attribute, not just color
2. **Unique Identification**: Each product variant has a unique code
3. **Better Inventory Management**: Easier to track and reference products
4. **Scalable**: Can accommodate various product types beyond clothing
5. **Professional**: More suitable for business inventory systems

## Application Status
- **Server**: Running on http://localhost:5002
- **Admin Login**: admin / admin123
- **Database**: Fresh with new schema and sample data
- **All Features**: Fully functional with new product code system

The migration has been completed successfully and the application is ready for use with the new product code-based inventory system.
